      <img src="assets/images/IMG_0201.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Anthony Cera">

      <p>My name is Anthony, I also go by Ace, I'm 26 years old. I was born in Panorama City
        and raised in Burbank, where I currently reside. When I'm not working as a chef
        to help pay for school, I usually start my day off with a lite of breakfast of bread
        and butter or an acai/fruit bowl. Afterwards I had to the gym for about an hour, run 
        some errands if I have any. Usually once I'm done with my errands I like to shower
        work on any HW assignments or additional learing I need to do.</p>
      <p>My hobbies include music, I play the guitar, bass, drums, keyboard and sing. I love to
        eat and try new foods or restaurants. I love to snowboard during the winter season. I usually
        only go to Bear/Summit Mountain if I only have a day to snowboard. Otherwise I love to snowboard
        at Mammoth Mountain whenever I have a free weekend and I'm able to go. I also like to play 
        soccer, golf, go hiking, watch movies with my friends/family. I also enjoy playing video games
        and I am a huge nerd at heart.
